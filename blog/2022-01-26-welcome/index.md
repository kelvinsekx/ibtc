IBTC is an acronym for **Ibadan Tech Community** which is presently at its founding and fresh state.

We are open to all tech professionals but with a present concentration on the JS community hoping as we expand, we are able to have other sub-communities standalone with their leaders.

As a community, our goals are to :
- foster talent incubation in Ibadan
- expose Ibadan tech talents
- encourage growth and domain expertise in tech
- support new talents

All of these goals are with the overall aim that Ibadan would retain, attract and amplify her tech talents.

IBTC is currently managed by **kelvinsekx**, a frontend engineer, and backed by **Jason Palmer**, senior PM Spotify and Jest maintainer.
